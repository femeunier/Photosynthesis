## Objectives of Practical B

During this second practical, we will further develop our leaf model to account for stomatal regulation. The FvCB developped during Practical A will be coupled to a stomatal conductance model (the Ball-Berry model) and applied to a Fluxnet site in Finland. We will evaluate its performance by comparing its prediction with observations of carbon uptake at this site.

## Theory

In practical A, we re-coded the  Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry model for C3 photosynthesis. For reminder, this model computed the net assimilation rate ($A_n$) from the internal concentration in CO<sub>2</sub> ($c_i$) and atmospheric/leaf variables and parameters:

$$
A_n = FcVB(c_i,atmoshere,leaf)
$$
Yet, the internal concentration $c_i$ cannot be directly measured: only the atmospheric concentration in CO<sub>2</sub> ($c_a$). Yet, $c_i$ can be derived from the stomatal aperture and the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> into the stomatal cavity:

$$A_n = \frac{g_{bw}}{1.4} (c_a - c_s) = \frac{g_{sw}}{1.6} (c_s - c_i)  = \frac{1}{1.4g_{bw}^{-1} + 1.6g_{sw}^{-1}} (c_a - c_i) $$

where $c_s$ is the CO<sub>2</sub> contentation at the leaf surface and $g_{bw}$ and $g_{sw}$ represent the boundary and stomatal conductances, respectively. To close the system of equations (there are three unknowns $c_i$, $g_{sw}$, and $A_n$ for only two equations), we will use in this practical the semi-empirical Ball-Berry model:

$$ g_{sw} = g_{min} + g_1 \frac{A_n}{c_s}h_s$$

where $g_{min}$ and $g_1$ are additional leaf parameters standing for the residual leaf conductance when stomatal are close and the stomatal slope, respectively. In addition, $h_s$ is the relative humidity at the leaf surface supposed to be equivalent to the open-air one. To resolve the system of three unknowns and three equations, we will use a simple convergence algorithm presented during the theory lecture and summarised in the following figure:

```{r f1, fig.cap='Algorithm to solve the set of equations', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('Algo.png')
```

The initial guess of $c_i$ is plugged into the FvCB model and allows computing $A_n$ which is in turn used to calculate $c_s$ from the diffusion equation. $c_s$ can then be used to compute the stomatal conductance which serves to re-estimate $c_i$ until some convergence criterion is met. You can find such algorithm in the `Photosynthesis` function attached to this practical.

Add radiative transfer model

## Site

We will applied this model to Hyytiala, Finland which is an Evergreen Needleleaf Forests. In other words, it is a land dominated by woody vegetation with a percent cover >60% and height exceeding 2 meters. Almost all trees remain green all year (see site image). Canopy is never without green foliage. The site is characterized by a Mean Annual Temperature of 3.8°C and a Mean Annual Precipitation of 709 mm.

```{r f2, fig.cap='Photo of the modelled site', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('fi-hyy-site15overview.gif')
```

## Before the practical

We have coded for you the model described above. So you just need to download it from Github. In Rstdio, run the following lines: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("femeunier/Photosynthesis")
```

And now the package should be made available for loading:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library("Photosynthesis")
```

## Questions and report details

0. First explore the package functions. The core is the $canopy_fluxes$ function that essentially takes care of all the steps described above. In particular, it calls the `Photosynthesis` function that solves the system of equations for each layer of vegetation, and aggregates the results. Also pay attention to the `FvCB` function that should be similar to the one you wrote yourself during the last practical.

1. Now, we are going to build and run the photosynthesis/stomatal conductance model. Create a new R script to compute the first 5000 timesteps. It should look like:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

rm(list = ls())

library(ggplot2)
library(Photosynthesis)

# Check the parameters for the functions canopy_fluxes
?canopy_fluxes

# we load needed parameters
# leaf physiolofical parameters
leaf <- Load.LeafPhysiologyParams()

# Adapt leaf photosynthetic parameters corresponding to average values for boreal conifers (Step 2)
# leaf$vcmax25
# leaf$jmax25

# We load meteo data from the fluxnet site
fluxnet_data<-read.table(file = "path/to/FLUXNET_FI-HYY_2005-2014.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",")

# Check and replace non-sensical values of met forcings here (Step 2)

#Fluxnet data: GPP in µmolCO2 m-2 leaf s-1
# we want to apply canopy_fluxes at each time step

siteLAI <- 6.7
apply.photosynthesis<-function(x,leaf,fluxnet_data){
  meteo<-fluxnet_data[x,]
  meteo$CO2<-410 # We don't forget atmospheric CO2 concentration, constant here
  gpp<-canopy_fluxes(meteo = meteo,leaf = leaf, LAI_layer = 20, LAI_tot = siteLAI)
  return(gpp)
}

N <- 5000 # number of timesteps to consider (Change here for Step 3)
results<-sapply(X = c(1:N),FUN = apply.photosynthesis,leaf=leaf,fluxnet_data=fluxnet_data)

# GPP is in µmolCO2 m-2 soil s-1, so we need to multiply by the site LAI
plot(results[1,1:N]*siteLAI,fluxnet_data$GPP[1:N])

```

Follow the workflow to see if you understand the steps explored by the scripts and the call to the functions.

2. Create a new script to load and explore the input (meterological) data (the FLUXNET_FI-HYY_2005-2014.csv file). Plot in particular the seasonal and diurnal cycles of the following variables: air temperature, relative humidity, short-wave radiation, and atmospheric pressure that force the photosynthesis/stomatal conductance model. If there are non-sensical values, replace them by the corresponding re-analysis columns (the equivalent ERA columns) 

3. Run the photosynthesis/stomatal conductance model for all the timesteps and compare with the observations

4. Re-run the model with more appropriate leaf parameters and compare with the previous simulation

5. Add outputs and compare sunlit and shaded leaves
